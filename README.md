Welcome to my **Info Center**.

Here is a collection of posts of various topics ranging from how-to's, to what I call "cheats" that I have found useful over the years, or anything else I have found.

Hopefully it can address some of the most frustrating parts of searching for problems, where many posted questions end in silence, dead-ends, with no solution to be found.

# Focus

The focus of this site will grow over time, but for now contains details surrounding IBM WebSphere Application Server, Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty, IBM MQ and more recently OpenShift.
