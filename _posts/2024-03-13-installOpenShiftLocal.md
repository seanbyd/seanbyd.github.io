title:  "Install OpenShift Local"

## Intro

I've installed and reinstalled OpenShift Local multiple times for testing on both my laptop and my desktop PC. This blog describes the condensed steps I followed to install OpenShift Local on my desktop PC. For a detailed guide refer to the references section.

## References

Primary Red Hat landing page:

[OpenShift overview](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview)

Download page for OpenShift Local. This includes the pull secret and a link to the setup guide:

Setup guide. This is what I followed. This blog has extracted the bare-bones from this guide to install and configure OpenShift Local.

## Minimum requirements

According to the OpenShift Local guide the following minimum requirements must be met:

- 4 physical CPU cores
- 9 GB of free memory
- 35 GB of storage space

## Environment

| Category | Details  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Desktop PC  | HP Omen, 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700K, 3600 MHz, 12 cores, 20 logical processors |
| Primary disk  | NVMe WD WD_BLACK Gen4 1TB disk |

The sizings I specified for the configuration is higher than the defaults for multiple reasons:

- I ran into issues with the default sizes not being high enough
- With the desktop PC specs I am able to set higher settings than the defaults which appear to be set as a minimum to run OpenShift Local on laptops
- I want to enable cluster monitoring and according to the OpenShift Local installation guide this requires a minumum of 14GB memory

## Download OpenShift Local

The first step is to download OpenShift Local. In my case I downloaded the Windows x86_64 installer.

https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local

This requires you to create and log into a Red Hat account.

Click the download button to download the file "crc-windows-installer.zip"

Unzip this file, run the installer and follow the prompts.

Take note of the following comment from the OpenShift Local installation guide: 

*"On Microsoft Windows, you must install Red Hat OpenShift Local to your local C:\ drive. You cannot run Red Hat OpenShift Local from a network drive."*

## Usage data collection

I chose to disable usage data collection

```cmd
crc config set consent-telemetry no
```

## Change selected defaults

From my general usage it is not necessary to change the defaults. I have been using OpenShift Local for some time without any issues.

Recently, however, I started to face issues with ephemeral storage and DiskPressure. So I decided to increase selected defaults.

These defaults should be set before issuing the "crc setup".

Update the number of CPUS from 4 (default) to 6. I'm not sure whether this is really needed but I decided to change anyway.

```cmd
crc config set cpus 6
```

Update the memory from 9 GB (default) to 25 GB. As I plan on enabling the monitoring that requires a minimum of 14 GB I chose a much higher value. To check the usage you can issue "crc status" - after installation I can see this going much higher than the default due to the components I am installing.

```cmd
crc config set memory 25600
```

I also used this as a chance to increase the disk size from 31 GB (default) to a much higher value. I chose 100 GB for no reason other than it's a much larger number.

```cmd
crc config set disk-size 100
```

Lastly I have decided to enable cluster monitoring. The default is off and the documentation states a minimum of 14 GB memory is required if this feature is enabled.

```cmd
crc config set enable-cluster-monitoring true
```

## Complete the setup

To complete the setup issue the command.

```cmd
crc setup
```

Once the setup is complete, start OpenShift Local.

```cmd
crc start
```

You should now be done and ready to use OpenShift Local!

## Some useful commands

```cmd
crc config
crc config get cpus
crc config get memory
crc config get disk-size
crc status
```

## Final comment

As part of my learning, I followed the below OpenLiberty guide. This put my OpenShift Local installation through its paces and is the primary reason I increased the default sizes. With the defaults I ran into problems with ephemeral memory and Disk Pressure.
